# SimCADA
 My university project from Survilance-Control System Software Design: A SCADA software that is supposed to simulate data aquisition, visualisation and notification of signals and alarms.

Due to the sudden COVID pandemic and time-constraints, we had to implement thread-unsafe components, but I plan to expand on this project in the future and make it thread-safe.
