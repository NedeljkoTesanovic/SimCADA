# MockSCADA
 A subject's project (Survilance-Control System Software Design): A MockSCADA software supposed to simulate data aquisition, visualisation and notification of signals and alarms.

Due to time-constraints, we had to implement thread-unsafe components. I plan to expand on this project and make it thread-safe in the future.
